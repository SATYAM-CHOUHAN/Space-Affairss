         <h4 class="info"> The Chandrayaan 3's Vikram lander, which entered sleep mode on Monday, has been pictured by the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter. It can be seen resting on the lunar surface near the Moon's South Pole, anticipating the arrival of sunrise. The hope is that when sunlight returns, the lander can reawaken, given that it withstands the ongoing harsh cold conditions.

         The image of Chandrayaan 3's lander shared by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was taken by the Dual-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR) instrument onboard the Chandrayaan 2 Orbiter on Wednesday. <p></p>

         Scientists at ISRO are hoping Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover to tolerate the instruments-freezing cold and start functioning when the Sun rises again on the Moon, expected around September 22.

The Aditya-L1 mission to study the Sun is slated to be launched at 11.50 am from the Sriharikota spaceport on Saturday.

             "The Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) payload on the Chandrayaan 3 Lander is the first instance of a Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology-based instrument on the moon. It has recorded the vibrations occurring due to the movements of Rover and other payloads," ISRO said.

           <h3 class="info_h">"Chandrayaan-3 equipped in every way..." Space scientist hopes for success of India's third lunar mission.</h3>
         <h4 class="info"> Asserting that the lander and rover of India's third lunar mission have been made from the learnings of Chandrayaan-2 failure, the former Professor of Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) RC Kapoor on Tuesday said that the Chandrayaan-3 is equipped in every way and its landing will be successful as prescribed.
          <p></p>
          The space scientist and astronomer, while speaking to said that this time the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has learned from the failure of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, launched in 2019.
             <p></p>
             Everything was checked at the time of Chandrayaan 2 and the world was waiting for its soft landing on the moon. But in the last moments when the distance of 2.1 km was left, then its contact was lost and the lander and rover of Chandrayaan-2 made a hard landing on the surface of the moon," Kapoor said.

           <h3 class="info_h">Ultra-powerful space explosion, 1st of its kind, may have been triggered by black hole star-destroyer</h3>

         <h4 class="info"> An example of an entirely new type of cosmic explosion that vastly outpowers most supernovas could be the result of a small or medium-sized black hole destroying a star.
          <p></p>

          The explosion, which has been named AT2022aedm, was seen emerging from a red galaxy located around 2 billion light-years from Earth by astronomers using the ATLAS network of robotic telescopes located in Hawaii, Chile, and South Africa. It was quickly recognized as something never seen before.
          <p></p>
          
          "We're always on the lookout for things that are a bit weird and different from standard kinds of supernovas, of which we find hundreds or even thousands per year," Matt Nicholl, leader of the team behind the discovery and an astrophysicist at Queenâ€™s University Belfast, told Space.com. "AT2022aedm stood out because it was one of the brightest explosions that we've ever seen, and it was also one of the fastest to fade away after its peak."
          <p></p>
          
          The explosion spotted by Nicholl and the team emitted as much as 100 times more energy than an average supernova. Plus, while supernovas fade over the course of months, Nicholl noted that AT2022aedm faded to 1% of its original brightness in just 14 days, after which it completely disappeared. That means, in just two weeks, AT2022aedm emitted as much energy as the sun will in its entire 10 billion-year lifetime.

           <h3 class="info_h">Dark matter 'clumps' found by tapping into Einstein's general <br>relativity theory</h3>

         <h4 class="info"> Astronomers have used a principle first proposed by Albert Einstein over 100 years ago to map the distribution of dark matter in unprecedented detail. The team's method managed to reveal the presence of dark matter "clumps" between galaxies, showing how this mysterious substance is distributed on smaller scales.
          <p></p>

          Fluctuations in the observed dark matter, identified between a distant quasar (or bright light source powered by a feeding supermassive black hole) and a galaxy between that quasar and Earth could help constrain the properties of the elusive substance.
          <p></p>
          
          Dark matter is troubling for scientists because, despite the fact it makes up about 85% of our universe, it is effectively invisible. This is because dark matter either doesn't interact with any electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, or does so incredibly weakly.
          <p></p>

          It is this puzzle that has prompted an intense search for these so-called dark matter particles.

          There's a lot of trash on the moon right now  including nearly 100 bags of human waste and with countries around the globe traveling to the moon, there's going to be a lot more, both on the lunar surface and in Earth's orbit.
          <p></p>
          
          In August 2023, Russia's Luna-25 probe crashed into the moon's surface, while India's Chandrayann-3 mission successfully landed in the southern polar region, making India the fourth country to land on the moon.
          <p></p>
          
          With more countries landing on the moon, people back on Earth will have to think about what happens to all the landers, waste and miscellaneous debris left on the lunar surface and in orbit.
